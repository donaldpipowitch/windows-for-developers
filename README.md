# Windows for developers

> Small notes from an ex-Mac user about developing on Windows.

Hello everyone. In [January '18 I switched to a Surface Book 2 (13 inch)](https://twitter.com/PipoPeperoni/status/953267367899025409) after using a MacBook Pro (13 inch) for eight years or so. I only had "soft reasons" to do that:

- the Surface line allways interested me - especially trying the Surface pen (I loved taking notes and drawing as a student)
- recent changes on the MacBook line seemed to be more problematic for me (e.g. touch bar)
- I always used a 13 inch laptop and the MacBooks have no dedicated graphics card in this size
- the MicroSoft culture in the last years seemed to be more attractive to me (more focus on developers, designers and open source)
- I only heard good things about the WSL
- I like to try new things!

The macOS High Sierra update actually bricked my MacBook Pro at the end of 2017, so I decided to switch to Windows 10 completely - as an "experiment". Maybe an expensive experiment, but I was supported by [Mercateo](https://github.com/Mercateo) to get some more diversity in our setup. (I was the first Windows developer after years with just Mac and Linux systems.) I used my system for three months now and here is a short review. Partially some personal experiences, partially a short tutorial for others.

> **tl;dr**: Yes, you can use a Windows system as your every day system for development. But the switch will not be easy and I can't recommend it to everyone. It really depends on your requirements.
